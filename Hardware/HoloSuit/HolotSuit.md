# Holosuit

## Short description

HoloSuit is a Virtual Reality Game suit which tracks and trains you in the real world while you enjoy the virtual world . It is a smart track suit with sensors embedded in them to track your every move at lightning speed. You can use the track suit either independently or while wearing an AR, VR or MR  display or viewing the avatar on an external display. The motion of the user in the real world is tracked, stored and virtualized. The suit is not  available for sale just yet, but you might be able to help them soon when they launch their [Kickstart campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/holosuit/1980024877?token=324ba19d).
